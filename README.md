# Structure of this Website
This website is suited for multiple purpose. It has blog, service seciton,contact form, image gallery with lighbox . It can be used for any small to medium sized organization. ALso I have implemented various features in this project. Homepage of the site is built with flexbox. I used various common flexbox layout pattern so that I can demosntarte how much powerful flexbox is.

# Featurs I implemented in this website
  - Firstly I used flexbox to make multilevel navigation menu which is also responsive. Then I used Wave generator to make wave like look at the bottom of the viewport                Which gives    a pretty look. Then Service section is made out of flexbox where I used equal spacing on three flex items.
  - In the next section, the second flex items takes the whole space whcih is not used by other flex items. 
  - After that  I used alternate grid in which every third item thakes the full width of the viewport and other two items 48% width. 
  - In galley section i make gallery with flexbox. On Hoveer it shows the details of the person and gives us the profile of the perosn in the image
  - In next section I designed branch section which uses flexbox in a way that maintains its 1:1 proportion
  - I also used vertical bars to demonstarate that flexbox can be used to make charts
